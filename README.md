# hello-world
getting started. Economics background. Pursuing data science
I took some basic programming in highschool back in 2006 along with advanced statistics and calculus. Had to code a little bit for my economics degree/statistical software. Familiar with general concepts of statistical analysis but working to get refreshed.
